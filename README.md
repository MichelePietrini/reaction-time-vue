# Ninja Reaction Time Game

This is a simple Vue.js game that tests your reaction time. When you click the "play" button, a block appears after a random delay. The game measures how quickly you react to the appearance of the block.

## Project setup

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichelePietrini/reaction-time-vue.git
```
Then, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd .\reaction-time\
```
Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
## Compiles and hot-reloads for development
To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run serve
```
Now, you can open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see the game in action.

## Game Instructions
Click the "play" button to start the game.
Wait for the block to appear.
Click the block as quickly as you can.
Your reaction time (in milliseconds) will be displayed.
Enjoy the game!
